/*
Write a function that returns the factorial of the supplied argument.
For any positive integer n, the factorial of n is the result of multiplying n by all the positive integers of lesser values. So the factorial of 5, which is usually written as 5!, is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1, or 120

// Althoug there is nothing groundbreajing about format of his stories and even the narrative is mostly linear, his writing is lively, and weÂ¡re drawn to the emotional chasm between characters. On top of that Doyle concots a deligthfully freakish cast of minor characters, evoking London's ghoulish underbelly.
